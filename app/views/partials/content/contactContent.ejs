      <p>Meet this owl, his name is Henry. Occasionally he would come and sit beside the window of our office. He will stay there for whole night and leave in the morning without saying anything. After observing this for extended period of time, Amarjot decided to give a snack to this owl from his daily lunchbox. So, as planned, he opened the window and put some ham in front of him. Owl immediatly ate the ham. This series of actions happend multiple times in future. In short, we care about living beings. so please don't be shy to contact us, if you have any enquiry.</p>
